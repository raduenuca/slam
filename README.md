# Landmark Detection &amp; Tracking (SLAM)
*Udacity - Computer Vision Nanodegree Program*

# Project Overview
Implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! Combines robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM gives the way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.
